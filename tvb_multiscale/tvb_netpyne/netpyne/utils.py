    """
    Returns a SpikeTrain whose spikes are a realization of a Poisson process
    with the given rate (Hz) and stopping time t_stop (milliseconds).

    Note: t_start is always 0.0, thus all realizations are as if 
    they spiked at t=0.0, though this spike is not included in the SpikeList.

    Inputs:
    -------
        rate    - the rate of the discharge (in Hz)
        t_start - the beginning of the SpikeTrain (in ms)
        t_stop  - the end of the SpikeTrain (in ms)
        array   - if True, a np array of sorted spikes is returned,
                    rather than a SpikeTrain object.

    Examples:
    --------
        >> gen.poisson_generator(50, 0, 1000)
        >> gen.poisson_generator(20, 5000, 10000, array=True)
